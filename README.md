# Baby-Monitoring-Using-Arduino
This project aids in countering this issue by providing a solution for it.
Keeping in mind that hiring a childminder is expensive and not entirely safe, this project
aims towards monitoring a baby without any third party involvement. The proposed
system monitors the temperature and heart rate of the infant, the humidity of the room,
motion detection, and also sound produced by the baby and adopts suitable measures
such as notifying the parent or switching on the motor for the cradle to start swinging.
These measures reduce the burden of the parent in monitoring the baby as the proposed
system ensures continuous monitoring. 

The main objective of the project is to help all the working parents in the present world
by taking care of their babies by continuously measuring and monitoring all the necessary
conditions of the baby using sound, humidity, temperature, heart rate and PIR sensors and
notifying them if any abnormal activity is identified. This is mainly to monitor the infant
and avoid infant death syndrome.
